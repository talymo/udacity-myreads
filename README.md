# MyReads Project

With the MyReads App you can keep track of all the books you have consumed in your life. From the ones you are reading to the ones you have read to the ones you want to read, it is all managed here. Simply move books between shelves and use the handy search feature to add even more books to your list.

## To start the app:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

After installing and starting simply open the app in the specified port of the console window and start categorizing your books!
